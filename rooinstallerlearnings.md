# Roo Installer Learnings

## Overview
This document captures key learnings and insights from implementing the Roo MCP installer and its various components. These learnings are particularly relevant for future LLM development and understanding of the system.

## Key Components and Their Purpose

### 1. MCP Settings Management
- The system uses a central `mcp_settings.json` file located in VSCode's global storage
- The file structure uses "mcpServers" as the main key to store MCP configurations
- Settings include command, args, cwd, env vars, and other MCP-specific configurations
- The system supports both global (user level) and project-level installations

### 2. Installation Database
- Installations are tracked in `installed_mcps.json` files
- Separate databases for global (~/.roo/installed_mcps.json) and project (./.roo/installed_mcps.json) scopes
- Each entry contains:
  - name: The MCP identifier
  - source: Original repository URL
  - subdir: Optional subdirectory within repo
  - scope: "global" or "project"
  - installed_at: Absolute path to installation
  - entry: Relative path to entry point
  - type: Language/runtime type (go, node, python, etc.)
  - required_env: List of detected environment variables

### 3. Environment Variable Handling
- System detects required environment variables through code analysis
- Currently supports Go-specific detection patterns (os.Getenv, viper.Get, etc.)
- Normalizes variable names (uppercase, hyphen to underscore)
- Handles known aliases (e.g., GITHUB_TOKEN â†’ GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN)
- Stores variables in config groups (github, gitlab, or MCP-specific)

### 4. File System Operations
- Uses atomic write operations for critical files (config, settings, databases)
- Implements backup/restore mechanisms for safety
- Handles platform-specific path conventions
- Uses safe directory removal with retries and permission fixes

## Critical Operations

### Installation Process
1. Parse and validate input (repo URL/slug, scope)
2. Setup/validate directory structure
3. Clone/update repository
4. Read and validate manifest
5. Build if needed (Go projects)
6. Configure environment variables
7. Create VSCode settings
8. Record installation
9. Run post-install hooks

### Uninstallation Process
1. Remove VSCode settings entry
2. Remove installation database entry
3. Delete installation directory
4. Handle cleanup failures gracefully

## Best Practices Learned

### 1. File Operations
- Always use atomic writes for configuration files
- Keep backups before modifications
- Handle encoding explicitly (UTF-8)
- Use platform-agnostic path handling
- Implement retry mechanisms for file operations

### 2. Error Handling
- Log all significant operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Clean up partial operations on failure
- Handle platform-specific quirks (Windows file locks, permissions)

### 3. Configuration Management
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Use schema validation
- Implement defaults sensibly
- Support multiple scopes (global/project)
- Handle missing/corrupted configurations gracefully

### 4. Environment Variables
- Detect requirements automatically when possible
- Normalize names consistently
- Handle sensitive values securely
- Support aliases and groups
- Provide clear descriptions

## Future Improvements

### 1. Manifest Handling
- Add support for more manifest formats
- Improve type detection
- Add validation for more language-specific fields
- Support dependencies declaration

### 2. Environment Detection
- Extend to other languages beyond Go
- Add pattern detection for more frameworks
- Improve alias handling
- Add validation of required values

### 3. Installation Management
- Add version management
- Implement dependency resolution
- Add update checking
- Improve cleanup on failed installations

### 4. Security
- Add signature verification
- Implement manifest trust levels
- Add sandboxing options
- Improve sensitive data handling

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **File Operations**
   - Don't assume file operations will always succeed
   - Handle permissions issues proactively
   - Consider platform differences
   - Always verify file contents after writes

2. **Configuration**
   - Don't assume config files exist
   - Handle corrupted configurations
   - Validate all user input
   - Maintain backward compatibility

3. **Environment**
   - Don't expose sensitive values in logs
   - Handle missing variables gracefully
   - Consider platform-specific paths
   - Validate variable values when possible

4. **Installation**
   - Don't assume network availability
   - Handle partial installations
   - Clean up failed installations
   - Verify all required components

## Testing Considerations

1. **File System**
   - Test atomic operations
   - Verify backup/restore
   - Check permission handling
   - Test path normalization

2. **Configuration**
   - Test corrupted files
   - Verify merge behavior
   - Check scope handling
   - Test defaults

3. **Installation**
   - Test network failures
   - Verify cleanup
   - Check hook execution
   - Test scope isolation

## Recent Implementation Learnings

### 1. Code Structure and Indentation
- Proper indentation is crucial for nested code blocks, especially in Python
- Try-except blocks require special attention to maintain proper nesting
- Common indentation patterns for try-except:
 ```python
 if condition:
     try:
         # Operation code here
     except Exception as e:
         # Exception handling here
 ```
- Improper indentation can lead to unexpected behavior and Pylance errors

### 2. Exception Handling Patterns
- Group related operations within a single try block
- Keep exception handling (except blocks) at the same level as their corresponding try
- Consider the scope of what's being protected by the try-except
- Handle cleanup operations consistently whether the main operation succeeds or fails

### 3. List Command Improvements
- Local mcp.json parsing requires careful error handling
- Structure the code to handle multiple configurations sources:
 - Local mcp.json
 - VSCode settings
 - Installation database
- Maintain proper error isolation between different configuration sources
- Use consistent indentation patterns across all configuration parsing

### 4. Code Maintenance
- Regular indentation checks help prevent subtle bugs
- Use IDE tools (like Pylance) to catch potential issues early
- Maintain consistent indentation patterns throughout the codebase
- Consider using automated formatting tools to prevent indentation issues

### 5. Error Handling Best Practices
- Keep error handling close to the operation that might fail
- Use appropriate exception types for different failure modes
- Maintain proper error message hierarchy:
 - Debug information in logs
 - User-friendly messages in stdout/stderr
 - Detailed error context in exception objects

 The key improvements in this version are:

Shows registered MCPs first with consistent indentation
Scans for unregistered MCPs in installation directories
Uses a set to track registered names and avoid duplicates
Provides helpful messages about unregistered MCPs
Includes better error handling for scanning
Has an improved docstring
The changes make it easier for users to discover and manage both registered and unregistered MCPs in their system.
